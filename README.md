## INTRODUCTION
Chessible is an RPG-based gamification dApp of the classic chess game, dApp means that you will be able to earn in the game. Within an RPG-based style approach, players have action points to distribute every turn between pieces' movement, attack, and defense - before and after the enemy plays as a pre-moved strategy, hence, creative, frenzied, and 100x more appealing to the classic chess.

1. Board: The game is played on an 8x8 square board with the same initial setup of pieces as traditional chess.
2. Life Points: Every piece has a set number of life points.
3. Actions: Every turn, players have a set number of action points, similar to the game "Hearthstone". Players can spend their action points on the following actions:
  - 1.1 Attacking: A piece can attack an opposing piece and decrease its life points.
  - 1.2 Defending: A piece can defend itself or another piece from an opposing attack.
  - 1.3 Moving: A piece can move to an adjacent square.
  - 1.4 Synthesizing: Two or more pieces can be combined to create a new, more powerful piece with unique abilities. (King and Queen cannot synthesize)
4. Action Points: Players have a limited number of action points each turn, which they can use to perform one or more of the actions described above.
5. Time Limit: Players also have a limited amount of time each turn to spend their action points.
6. Present and Future Actions: Actions can be categorized as either "present" or "future" actions:
  - 6.1 Present Actions: These are actions that can be performed instantly during the player's turn.
  - 6.2 Future Actions: These are actions that are scheduled to be performed during the opponent's turn, such as a surprise move.
  - 6.3 Note: Defense actions can only be future actions, while attack and move actions can be either present or future.
7. Future Move Actions: When a move action is performed as a future action, the piece moving during the opponent's turn can collide with other pieces, attacks, and defenses.
8. Synthesis Rules: The following rules apply when synthesizing pieces:
  - 8.1 Combination Requirements: To synthesize pieces, players must have a specific combination of pieces.
  - 8.2 Cost: Synthesizing pieces may require sacrificing one or more pieces or using a limited resource.
  - 8.3 Limits: Players may be limited in the number of times they can synthesize pieces in a game or the number of pieces they can have at a time.
  - 8.4 Effects: Each new piece created through synthesis will have unique abilities or effects on the game.
  - 8.5 Feedback: The game will provide feedback to the player on the abilities and effects of the synthesized piece.
  - 8.6 Special Rules: Special rules may be added for synthesized pieces, such as limiting the number of times they can be used in a game or prohibiting them from being broken down again.
These rules provide a framework for the RPG chess game "Chessible" and offer players new ways to approach each turn, engage in strategic decision-making, and grow their knowledge structures.

### WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO?
I'm trying to make a chess game from scratch, but with additional features to make the game more dynamic and creative rather than purely logical and intricate. As the community around chess game grows, it is common to get bored with the always same game style, and chess players have an urge to expand their creativity into tactics. Furthermore, with the decentralized internet coming strong to ease virtual assets management, the platform also intends to make a collection of rare pieces and boards available and optionally gamble in matches against other players.

### Why would people like such a bizarre thing?
I don't know, doing this just for fun and learning.

### If Chessible receives approval, what then?
Further goals include gamefy as a platform for state-of-art user experience, with progressive improvements, status, item rarity, and different pieces to collect along with the time.
