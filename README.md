## introduction
Chessible is an RPG-based gamification dApp of the classic chess game, dApp means that you will be able to earn in the game. Within an RPG-based style approach, players have action points to distribute every turn between pieces' movement, attack, and defense - before and after the enemy plays as a pre-moved strategy, hence, creative, frenzied, and 100x more appealing to the classic chess. 

### What am I trying to do?
I'm trying to make a chess game from scratch, but with additional features to make the game more dynamic and creative rather than purely logical and intricate. As the community around chess game grows, it is common to get bored with the always same game style, and chess players have an urge to expand their creativity into tactics. Furthermore, with the decentralized internet coming strong to ease virtual assets management, the platform also intends to make a collection of rare pieces and boards available and optionally gamble in matches against other players.

### why would people like such a bizarre thing?
Modern times require modern solutions.

### If Chessible receives approval, what then?
Further goals include gamefy as a platform for state-of-art user experience, with progressive improvements, status, item rarity, and different pieces to collect along with the time.

### technical differential features:
- (in development) the ability to schedule attacks and defenses after the enemy plays
- (in development) action points to spend between attack, defense, and movement
- (in development) choose spending action points between before and after the next enemy turn
- (in development) use WebGL to render state-of-art panels, board and pieces
